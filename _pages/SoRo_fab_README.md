[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build-Passing-success)]()

Visit the [Github repository](https://github.com/lefaris/SoRo-fab) for a detailed, standardized fabrication methodology for creating untethered terrestrial soft robots (uTerreSoRo) with comprehensive documentation of design principles, manufacturing best practices, and performance evaluation frameworks.  This is supplementary material for the in-progress paper **An Open-Source Fabrication Strategy and Repeatability Analysis for Motor-Tendon Actuated (MTA) Soft Robots** that will be submitted soon.

## Overview

> **Work in Progress**: This repository is being actively developed alongside the paper submission process. Additional materials including CAD files, detailed fabrication guides, and extended documentation will be added progressively. Star/watch this repository for updates!

Soft robotics is a rapidly advancing field, but soft robots (SoRos) remain rare in everyday applications due to complexities in design and lack of consistency in fabrication techniques. Unlike rigid robots with standardized manufacturing pipelines, SoRos still lack broadly adopted methodologies and transparent reporting of fabrication practices.

This work addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Detailed fabrication methodology** for motor-tendon actuated soft robots
- **Critical design principles** including cavity optimization and bio-inspired stiffness gradients  
- **Best practices** for motor anchoring and rigid-soft integration
- **Comprehensive repeatability and reproducibility analysis** across multiple prototypes
- **Task-based performance evaluation** with statistical validation
