## Overview

TeXploR is a unique tensegrity robot comprised of two semi-circular curved links held together by a continuous elastic cable in 12 prestressed segments. The robot achieves locomotion through internal mass shifting along each link, enabling efficient rolling with enhanced stability (e.g., tip-over resistance on inclines).  Our work presents a geometric modeling framework to describe the hybrid system behavior of TeXploR.

### Key Contributions

- **Curved-Link Tensegrity Design**: Two semi-circular links connected with an elastic cable to maintain structural integrity
- **Internal Actuation**: Internal masses shift along GT2 timing belts for locomotion with ~1:1 (431g:427g) arc to shifting mass ratio
- **Geometric Modeling**: Piecewise continuous approach models the holonomic constraints and pivot points
- **Four-State Hybrid System**: Rolling locomotion through state transitions between ground contact points

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB R2020b or later
- Arduino IDE (for hardware deployment)
- Gazebo (optional, for world simulation)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lefaris/TeXploR-geometric.git
cd TeXploR-geometric

# Set up MATLAB path
# Add all subdirectories to your MATLAB path
```

### Running the Geometric Model

```matlab
% Open MATLAB and navigate to geometric modeling directory
cd 'geometric modeling/FixingNonvalidVals'

% For theta1, theta2 input values, find the corresponding
% transformation matrix Tsb and zb, and plot the positions
example = TExploRStatics(0,90)
staticPoses = example.computeStaticPoses()

% You can also access other properties of the static class
case2_Tsb_1 = staticPoses.Case2(1).Tsb
```

### Running Gazebo Simulations (work in progress)

```bash
# Launch Gazebo simulation
cd gazebo
roslaunch sphericon_test2 gazebo.launch
```
