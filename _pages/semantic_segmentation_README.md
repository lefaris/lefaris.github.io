**Semantic Segmentation for Targeted Roadside Vehicle Detection Using Camera and LiDAR**

Visit the [Github repository](https://github.com/UA-Roadside-Semantic-Segmentation/Multimodal-Roadside-Detection) for additional implementation of a portable, multimodal semantic segmentation system for roadside vehicle detection, as published in *Sensors* journal. The system uses both camera (RGB) and LiDAR sensors to identify and segment train cars and semi-trucks while ignoring other motor vehicles.

## Overview

This work presents a comprehensive multimodal approach to roadside vehicle detection and semantic segmentation. The system enables:

- **Targeted vehicle detection** for train cars and semi-trucks
- **Multimodal sensor comparison** between multiple 360° LiDAR and an RGB camera
- **Edge deployment** on embedded NVIDIA Jetson platforms for real-time inference

## Model Architectures

### Camera Model (DeepLabV3+ with MobileNetV2)

- **Architecture**: DeepLabV3+ with MobileNetV2 backbone
- **Input**: RGB images (variable resolution)
- **Output**: Binary segmentation mask (vehicle/background)
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained on PASCAL-VOC dataset
- **Augmentations**: Gaussian noise, random flipping, random crops

### LiDAR Model (Custom CNN)

- **Architecture**: Custom CNN inspired by DeepLabV3+
- **Input**: Spherical projection of point clouds (XYZI channels)
- **Key Innovation**: Asymmetric downsampling to preserve spatial information
- **Resolution Handling**: Nearest-neighbor upsampling for unified model
- **Output**: Per-pixel classification (vehicle/background)
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Augmentations**: Random flipping, Gaussian noise (range and intensity)

### Spherical Projection

LiDAR point clouds are converted to image representation via spherical projection:
- Euclidean (XYZ) into spherical coordinates
- Spherical coordinates projected onto image plane
- Resolution: scanlines x horizontal points
- 4 channels: X, Y, Z, Intensity
