This is an advanced undergraduate course that I developed in the field of computer vision. Computer vision is a rapidly 
expanding area and it is becoming progressively easier for developers to make use of this field due to the ready availability of high quality libraries (such as OpenCV2). This course is intended to facilitate the practical use of computer vision with the goal being to bridge the gap between theory and the practical implementation of computer vision.
