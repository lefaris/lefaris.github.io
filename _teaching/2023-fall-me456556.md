This is an advanced undergraduate/introductory graduate course in the field of Mechatronics and Robotics covering electronics, microcontroller programming + interfacing, data acquisition, and sensing. I created and lectured material for one of the three modules covered in the class: Raspberry Pi and Fundamentals of Python.  I additionally created one of the three labs where students performed real-time object tracking with OpenCV on Raspberry Pis.  I assisted students and helped debug code during multiple lab days for all three labs.
