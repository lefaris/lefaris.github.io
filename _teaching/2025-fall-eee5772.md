This is an advanced graduate course that I developed in the field of Robotics covering the topics of computer vision 
and control applied to mobile robots and manipulators. This course provides the fundamentals of robotics, camera models, image processing, feature extraction, multi-view geometry, and visual servo systems.  EEE5772 involves a semester-long project in which the students prepare an accompanying manuscript for conference submission.
