This is an advanced undergraduate course discussing logic gates, building sequential circuits on breadboards, 
simulating circuits in Quartus Prime, solving K-maps, and programming VHDL and FSMs.  I taught all 9 labs, answered 
questions during office hours, and debugged code during lab sessions.  I also graded all the lab demos and reports.
